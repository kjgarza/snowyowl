# Tasks

This file contains tasks for automated implementation using SnowyOwl.

## Guidelines

- Use `- [ ]` checkbox format for tasks
- Be specific and actionable
- Include context and requirements
- Break large tasks into subtasks
- Reference existing patterns when possible

## Linked Specifications

For complex tasks, you can link to detailed specification files:

```markdown
- [ ] [Task name](./specs/specification.md)
```

Benefits:
- Keep TASKS.md clean and focused
- Provide Copilot with detailed context
- Reuse specifications across tasks
- Version control your requirements

See `LINKED_TASKS.md` for more information.
