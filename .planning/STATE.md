# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Enable parallelized overnight execution of planned GSD phases so that extensive daytime planning translates directly into shipped code by morning, without manual intervention.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Mode Management

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation & Mode Management)
Plan: 0 of TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-01 — Roadmap created with 4 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dual-mode system (TASKS + GSD): Both modes coexist, environment variable switches between them
- Delegate to /gsd:execute-phase: Reuse GSD orchestration rather than reimplementing
- File system scanning for readiness: Deterministic file presence checks, no Claude invocation during scanning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-01 (roadmap creation)
